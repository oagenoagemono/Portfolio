## 1. C010r (Self Made Game)
[C010r](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YAG6f4t_sFetUVtUEmeTYol2bLsgFdTz?usp=sharing) is a game that I made in a middle school summer camp hosted by DigiPen, where I took a game design class. For our last project, we had a game jam with the topic "Octarine", a term used to describe the color of magic. Since we did not learn any complex coding, I settled upon doing a simple 2D action game where you gather items in the color of the rainbow. Although I did not have the time or knowledge to implement it, I did have a story in mind. The main character was a girl who was hospitalized due to some accident, and as she recovered, she was gaining back her memories and life through the items that she collected. Since she was nearing death, she needed the "octarine" item to gain back her life (by magic), which was why the world is colorless until she gathers the items. 

## 2. Fruits: Fall Flat (Human: Fall Flat Level)
[Fruits: Fall Flat](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2675440078) is a Human: Fall Flat level that I made for fun. I was interested in using Unity and Blender, and so when I found the [tutorials on how to make a Human: Fall Flat Level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctr9Yi4D6is&t=1s), I wanted to do it myself too. I mostly used the assets provided by Human: Fall Flat, but I also made some assets in blender, such as the egg-shaped islands and fruits.
